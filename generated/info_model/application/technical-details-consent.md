# Technical details consent

Technical Details Consent (TDC) is the second stage of the 'Permission in Principle' (PiP) process in planning, primarily for housing-led development. It follows the initial 'Permission in Principle' stage, which establishes whether a site is suitable in principle for development. TDC assesses the detailed design, layout, and other technical aspects of the proposed development.
