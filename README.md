# Planning application data specification

This repository contains data specifications used to exchange planning application data.

It is an initiative lead by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governemnt (MHCLG) aiming to standardise what data is exchanged when a planning application is submitted.

The specification will consist of a number of "modules", one data specification per module, and will set out which modules are required for each application type.

This initiatives aims to improve the use, interoperability and consistency of planning application data that moves through the UK planning system.

#### Background

We started this initiative to create baseline planning application specifications that can be evolved over time, and to improve the use, interoperability and consistency of planning application data that flows through the UK planning system. For some background, you can check out our[ initial blog post](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2024/10/18/using-data-design-to-transform-the-planning-application-process-get-involved/) and a follow upblog post about the [first 2 events we held](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2024/12/06/digital-planning-developing-planning-applications-specifications-in-the-open/).

To support this work, we set up [an advisory group](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/advisory-group) and have been sharing high-level updates through a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions/98). However, as the discussion has grown quite lengthy, weâ€™ve decided to create this repository to help manage the issues more effectively, allow contributors to focus on them one at a time.


## Application types

Below is the list of official application types, and their sub-types where application that we are working through.

You can download a csv of [planning application types](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/blob/main/data/planning-application-type.csv) and [sub-types](http://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/blob/main/data/planning-application-sub-type.csv).

## Contributing

It is important that these specifications work for the people (software vendors, planning officers, analysts, policy makers) that need them. For that to happen we need feedback, questions and contributions from the community.

You can comment on any of the items in this respository and we encourage you to help us work through the [issues](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/issues).
