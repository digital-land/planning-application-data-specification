## v0.1.0 (2025-06-18)

MHCLG worked with the planning community to develop a set of specifications for the submission of planning applications. A first draft of these specifications was completed by the end of March 2025. We they asked for feedback on them. This feedback window finished on 16 May 2025. Since then we have been turning the feedback into issues to be worked through.
