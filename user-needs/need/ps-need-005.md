As a strategic planner or economic development analyst
I need to understand the volume and outcomes of major employment-related development applications (offices, R&D, light industry)
so that I can monitor changes in local employment space, understand economic growth patterns, and ensure the area has suitable land and floorspace to support business and jobs.

As a development management planner,
I need to understand small-scale housing proposals and their outcomes
