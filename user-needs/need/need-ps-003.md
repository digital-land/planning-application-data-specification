name: Track injunction outcomes
statement: >
  As a planning policy officer, I need to understand when injunctions are sought and whether they are granted or refused so that I can identify cases where breaches require severe legal intervention, understand the scale of complex or high-risk enforcement situations, and ensure that planning controls are being upheld where harm would otherwise continue.
