name: Track public service infrastructure decisions
statement: >
  As a strategic planner, place-shaping lead, or central government analyst I need to understand the volume and outcomes of major public service infrastructure applications so that I can track how essential services capacity is changing, identify where new provision is being supported or constrained, and plan for population needs across health, education, justice, and community services.
