Similar needs:

As a planner, I need forms and standards that evolve with legislation so that I’m not stuck with outdated requirements.

As a planner, I need to know that my feedback on data standards will be heard so that I can stop relying on workarounds and influence future improvements.

As MHCLG, I need a community process for evolving standards so that they don’t stagnate or depend entirely on software suppliers.

As a planning authority, I need to coordinate with peers (e.g. GLA, Camden) so that we identify common needs and avoid duplicating work.
