Requiring a `name` field on every dataset gives services a consistent display label, which matters when planning decisions rely on human judgement and discussion rather than long identifiers.

For example, a planning condition name lets services present conditions clearly instead of relying on codes alone, and a Site name lets planners refer to the site in discussions and reports with less ambiguity.
