    "description": "Complete demolition of the Grade II listed Victorian warehouse building at 123 Industrial Street. The building comprises a three-storey brick and timber construction with cast iron windows, covering approximately 2,400 square metres of floor area.",
    "reason": "The building has suffered extensive structural damage due to fire and subsequent water damage. A structural engineer's report confirms that the building is beyond economic repair and poses a significant safety hazard. The cost of restoration would exceed Â£2.5 million, which is not economically viable for the proposed redevelopment."
