  "grounds-for-application": "The proposed works to the Grade II listed building constitute minor alterations to the internal layout that do not affect the character or appearance of the listed building. The works involve the removal of non-original partition walls installed in the 1980s and do not impact any historic fabric or features of architectural or historic interest. Under section 7 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, these works do not constitute 'works for the demolition of a listed building or for its alteration or extension in any manner which would affect its character as a building of special architectural or historic interest' and therefore do not require listed building consent.",
