    "description": "Proposed two-storey rear extension to existing dwelling to provide additional living space including enlarged kitchen and new bedroom above. Extension will match existing brick construction with slate roof tiles.",
    "dwellinghouse-height": 8.5,
    "proposed-height": 11.2,
    "impact-on-amenity": "The extension will result in some loss of light to the rear windows of neighbouring property at 42 High Street. Mitigation includes stepped design reducing height adjacent to boundary and use of roof lights rather than dormer windows to minimize visual impact. Privacy concerns addressed through obscured glazing on side elevation windows.",
    "air-traffic-defence-impacts": "The proposed height increase is below aviation obstacle thresholds and will not impact air traffic or defence installations. No mitigation required.",
    "protected-view-impact": "The development is not located within any protected view corridors and will not impact designated views. The extension is positioned to the rear and will not be visible from the street scene or any heritage assets."
