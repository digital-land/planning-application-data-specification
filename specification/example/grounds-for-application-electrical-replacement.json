  "grounds-for-application": "The replacement of modern electrical installations within the Grade II* listed building using like-for-like routes and methods constitutes essential maintenance that does not affect the building's special architectural or historic interest. The existing electrical system was installed in the 1970s and is not original to the building. The proposed works follow established cable routes within later floor voids and wall cavities, avoiding all historic fabric and decorative elements. The work is necessary for health and safety compliance and building insurance requirements, and the methods proposed ensure no impact on the listed building's character.",
