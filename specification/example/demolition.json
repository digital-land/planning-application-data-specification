    "description": "Demolition of the 1960s concrete extension to the rear of the Grade II listed Georgian townhouse. The extension was added without planning consent and is not in keeping with the architectural character of the original building.",
    "reason": "The concrete extension detracts from the historic character and architectural integrity of the Grade II listed building. Its removal will restore the original proportions and appearance of the Georgian facade and allow for a more sympathetic replacement extension using traditional materials."
