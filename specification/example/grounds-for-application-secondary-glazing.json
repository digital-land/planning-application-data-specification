  "grounds-for-application": "The proposed installation of conservation-grade secondary glazing to the historic windows constitutes maintenance work that preserves the special character of the Grade I listed building. The secondary glazing system has been specifically designed to be completely reversible, with minimal fixings that do not penetrate the historic window frames. The work enhances the building's thermal performance while preserving its historic fabric and visual appearance. As the work does not alter or affect the character of the listed building, listed building consent is not required under current planning law and guidance.",
