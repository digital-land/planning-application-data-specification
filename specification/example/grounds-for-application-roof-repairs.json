  "grounds-for-application": "The proposed repair and conservation of the Grade I listed building's historic roof structure using traditional materials and methods constitutes essential maintenance that preserves rather than alters the building's special character. The work involves the repair of failing timber elements using matching hardwood and traditional joinery techniques, and the replacement of damaged historic roof tiles with reclaimed materials of matching provenance. All work follows the principle of minimal intervention and maximum retention of historic fabric. As the work constitutes like-for-like repair and conservation using traditional methods and materials, it does not require listed building consent under established planning guidance.",
