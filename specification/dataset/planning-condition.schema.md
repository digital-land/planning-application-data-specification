      description: >
        A catalogue of planning condition clauses that are legislation-like
        in nature. Each record represents the text of a condition and its rationale,
        designed for reuse across multiple planning decisions. The clauses themselves
        are not legally binding until they are attached to a specific decision, where
        they take effect as enforceable requirements.
