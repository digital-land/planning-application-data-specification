notes: |
  * decision notices are not issued at committee; they are held back until the Section 106 agreement is negotiated and in place
  * that means you can have a committee decision in principle, but the formal decision notice can be delayed for months (sometimes years) until the s106 is agreed
  * so the notice and s106 effectively need to land together
  * this delay is a key data gap we want to capture (committee date vs decision notice date) to show the time taken to negotiate s106.
