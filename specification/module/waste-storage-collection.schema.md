This module captures information about waste management provisions for new developments. It covers two main aspects:

**Waste Storage Areas**: Whether the development requires dedicated waste storage areas and if so, details about their design, location, size, and access arrangements.

**Recycling Arrangements**: Whether the development includes separate recycling provisions and if so, details about the types of materials to be recycled, collection methods, and storage facilities.

This information helps planning authorities assess whether adequate waste management infrastructure is being provided and whether it meets local waste management policies and requirements.
