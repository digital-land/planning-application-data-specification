# Issue tracker

We have been collecting feedback, triaging and working through that feedback.

Below is a list of the modules we still have open issues for. It also includes the number of issues for that module that we've parked and added to a [backlog](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3ABacklog).

When there are no more current issues for a module the module will disappear from the list ([see modules with zero issues](https://github.com/digital-land/planning-application-data-specification/blob/main/issue-tracking/no-issues.md)).
