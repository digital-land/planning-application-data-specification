# Components

Components are reusable substructures or data shapes made up of multiple [fields](fields.md) (e.g. a person, an address).

They group fields into logical, structured units that can be reused across contexts.

Having a consistent structure for how components are described and reused across modules enables shared definitions, clarity, and better validation
